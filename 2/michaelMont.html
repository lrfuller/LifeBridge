        <h2>Driven by patient-oriented care.</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Michael Mont, M.D., is an orthopedic surgeon with over <strong>30 years of experience in complex hip and knee
                reconstructive surgery</strong>. He returns to the Rubin Institute for Advanced Orthopedics after
            serving as vice president of strategic initiatives for orthopedic surgery for Northwell Health, and joint
            reconstruction system chief and attending orthopedic surgeon at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. Prior
            to his time in New York, he served as chairman for the orthopedic department at the Cleveland Clinic and as
            director of the Rubin Institute's Center for Joint Preservation and Replacement.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mont has performed more than <strong>10,000 joint replacements</strong>, and he receives requests from
            around the globe to provide consultations for patients with complex orthopedic cases. He specializes in
            joint preservation, replacements, hip resurfacings and revisions. Dr. Mont performs the most difficult hip
            and knee replacements. He has become known as the reconstructive surgeon of last resort as he is sent cases
            from across the country and around the world that other surgeons are reluctant to attempt.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mont a world-recognized leading authority in the field of avascular necrosis (AVN), which is also known
            as osteonecrosis (ON). He is author of over <strong>800 peer-reviewed publications</strong> and has received
            over <strong>100 government and industry grants</strong>. Over the last 30 years of practice, he has helped
            to revolutionize the treatment protocol for AVN, mastering joint-saving procedures such as core
            decompression, percutaneous drilling and bone grafting.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mont strongly believes that healthcare should be a full-team approach and that the patient is at the
            center of that team. He is committed to providing education so that his patients are well informed. He and
            his team are highly accessible; he has given every patient he has helped throughout his entire career his
            cell phone number.</p>
        <p>Although Dr. Mont is an orthopedic surgeon, he utilizes the latest medications, techniques and tools
            available to delay the need for joint replacement as long as possible. Dr. Mont educates his patients about
            their unique disease process and exhausts all non-operative treatment options before recommending surgery.
            As a result, many of his patients are effectively treated with nonsurgical interventions, including weight
            loss, physical therapy, oral medication and injections. </p>

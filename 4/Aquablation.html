                        LifeBridge Health is the first health system in Maryland to offer Aquablation therapy to treat
                        lower
                        urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia. BPH is a
                        significant
                        health condition affecting one in two men between the ages 51 â€“ 60.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When medication and other nonsurgical treatments are unavailable or cannot relieve symptoms,
                        surgery is
                        the recommended treatment for many conditions that affect the male reproductive and urinary
                        tract
                        organs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If left untreated, BPH can cause significant health problems, including irreversible bladder or
                        kidney
                        damage, bladder stones and incontinence. It is the number one reason men visit a urologist.

                Aquablation therapy uses the power of water delivered with robotic precision to provide long-lasting BPH
                relief without compromise. It is precise, consistent and predictable, and provides long-term relief no
                matter how large your prostate.

                    <li style="margin-bottom: 7px;">Aquablation is the only BPH procedure that integrates ultrasound
                        imaging with a cystoscope. This
                        gives the surgeon the ability to see the entire prostate in real time, allowing them to map
                        which parts of the prostate to remove and avoid. This allows the surgeon to avoid removing parts
                        of the prostate that can cause irreversible complications.</li>

                Options?</h1>

        <div class="article__rtf rtf">
            <p>
                The problem with BPH surgical treatments today is that they often force men to trade off between symptom
                relief and side effects, limiting patients to choose between either a high degree of symptom relief with
                high rates of irreversible complications (such as incontinence, erectile dysfunction or ejaculatory
                dysfunction) or a low degree of symptom relief with low rates of irreversible complications.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aquablation eliminates the tradeoff between safety and efficacy, and predictably treats all prostate
                shapes and sizes without compromise.

<p class="MsoNormal">Did you know that heart failure afflicts over 5 million Americans? According to the Centers for
    Disease Control and Prevention, approximately half of those affected will die within five years of being diagnosed.
    To help patients manage this serious condition and prevent further life-threatening issues related to it, the
    LifeBridge Health Cardiovascular Institute is proud to offer its Heart Failure Center.<br>
    <br>
    At the Heart Failure Center, our heart health experts work together to diagnose, treat and educate patients and
    families about heart failure. We work in collaboration with your heart doctor and primary care provider to provide
    the support and care you need to make a full recovery. Through comprehensive treatment, cutting-edge technology and
    a wide range of support services, we help our patients regain the strength and confidence they need to lead normal,
    healthy lives.
